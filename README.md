## Overview

### About The Project

The objective of the [Ref1.App](https://ref1.app) was to create an engaging, visually appealing, and easy to use web app for all Formula 1 fans through the use of a modern stack. I was inspired to create a tool that could benefit new and lifelong fans of the sport. The app aims to address some of the pain points within the online experience that fans have had up until this point in terms of finding the Formula 1 info they want.

 
### Parts + Stack

This project has 3 parts:
 1. The Frontend ( This repo )
    * React

 2. The API  ( [Backend repo](https://github.com/claudiovf/ref1-Backend) )
  * NodeJS
  * Typescript
  * GraphQL
  * Mongoose
  * JWT
  * MongoDB 
 3. The Admin Dashboard ( [Admin repo](https://github.com/claudiovf/ref1-admin) )
  * React
  * Typescript
  * GraphQL 
  * Semantic-ui-css

## The Problem

Formula 1 fans need an easy way to find the statistics they are after. So far, all that was available to fans were poorly formatted websites with lots of links and tables and lists. Add to that the obscene amount of ads and you have something almost unusable, specially during a race when you dont want spend too long reading an entire Wikipedia article, or decrypting your way through bad websites just to find who had the most podiums in 2013 for example (it was Vettel by the way). 


## The Challenges

 * Formula 1 has over 70 years of rich history. That makes it difficult to have all countless stats of over 1000 races, 850 drivers and 210 teams within a few clicks away.
 *  Remove all the unnecessary links, lists, tables, dropdown boxes, filters, etc.
 *  Make it intuitive, modern and beautiful.
